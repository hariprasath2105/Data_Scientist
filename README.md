## Supervised Learning 

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification - (Flask App)

- **Decision Trees** – [Decision Tree Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/Decision_Tree)  
- **Random Forest** – [Random Forest Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/Random_Forest)  
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** – [SVM Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/SVM)  
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** – [KNN Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/KNN)  
- **Logistic Regression** – [Logistic Regression Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/Logistic_Regression)  
- **Naive Bayes** – [Naive Bayes Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/Naive_Bayes)  
- **Gradient Boosting** – [Gradient Boosting Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/Gradient_Boosting)

### 2. Regression - (Gradio App)

- **Linear Regression** – [Linear Regression Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/Linear_Regression)  
- **Ridge Regression** – [Ridge Regression Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/Ridge_Regression)  
- **Lasso Regression** – [Lasso Regression Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/Lasso_Regression)  
- **Elastic Net Regression** – [Elastic Net Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/Elastic_Net)

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning uses **unlabeled data** to find patterns and relationships.

### 1. Clustering - (Flask App)

- **K-Means** – [K-Means Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/K-Means_Clustering)  
- **Hierarchical Clustering** – [Hierarchical Clustering Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/Heirarchical_Clustering)  
- **DB_SCAN** – [DB_SCAN Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/DB_Scan)

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction - (Flask App)

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – [PCA Repo](https://github.com/hariprasath2105/PCA)
